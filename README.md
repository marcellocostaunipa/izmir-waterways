## Day 01: Basic Map and Geographic Concepts

### Morning Session: Fundamentals of p5.js and Geographic Concepts

- Introduction to p5.js: setup(), draw(), and basic shapes
- Understanding geographic coordinates vs. pixel coordinates
- Creating a simple map with basic shapes
- Implementing the geoToPixel() function to convert between coordinate systems

### Afternoon Session: Working with GeoJSON Data

- Introduction to GeoJSON format and structure
- Loading and parsing geographic data
- Plotting points on a map
- Creating a simple visualization of dam locations

### Hands-on Exercise:

- Create a basic map showing the Izmir province as a rectangle
- Plot the dam locations as simple circles
- Add labels for each dam

## Day 2: Detailed Map and Visual Representation

### Morning Session: Detailed Geographic Representation

- Drawing complex shapes with beginShape() and endShape()
- Creating a more accurate boundary representation
- Adding visual hierarchy with colors and stroke weights
- Implementing a legend and UI elements

### Afternoon Session: Data Visualization Principles

- Encoding data attributes visually (size, color, opacity)
- Representing water levels with visual elements
- Creating a consistent visual language
- Adding context with labels and legends

### Hands-on Exercise:

- Implement the detailed Izmir boundary using vertex points
- Enhance dam visualization to show water levels
- Create a legend explaining the visualization elements
- Add UI elements like title and attribution

## Day 3: Interactivity and Tooltips

### Morning Session: Mouse Interaction in p5.js

- Detecting mouse position and clicks
- Creating hover effects
- Implementing tooltips
- Handling mouse events

### Afternoon Session: Interactive Data Exploration

- Creating interactive elements (buttons, sliders)
- Implementing selection states
- Building tooltips and information displays
- Designing for user engagement

### Hands-on Exercise:

- Add hover effects to highlight dams when the mouse is over them
- Create tooltips that show dam information on hover
- Implement click functionality to select a dam
- Design a simple information panel for the selected dam

## Day 4: Detailed Information Panel and Final Touches

### Morning Session: Data Visualization Enhancements

- Creating charts and graphs within p5.js
- Visualizing time-series data
- Animation techniques
- Implementing multiple view modes

### Afternoon Session: Polishing and Extending the Project

- Refining the user interface
- Adding finishing touches
- Exploring additional features
- Deploying and sharing your visualization

### Hands-on Exercise:

- Implement a detailed information panel for selected dams
- Create a timeline chart showing historical water levels
- Add animation capabilities to visualize changes over time
- Enhance the project with additional features like comparison views or filtering options

## Day 5: Add layers
## Day 5.1 Add dam shapes in details panel (fixed aspect ratio)
